- [ ] PG client-cert auth over WireGuard — drop the plaintext `DATABASE_URL` password.
  - Edit `pg_hba.conf` on NUC: `hostssl dashboard trader 10.10.0.0/24 cert clientcert=verify-full`
  - Generate + distribute `secrets/postgres-client.{key,crt}` to VPS (600, `trader:trader`)
  - Shrink `DATABASE_URL` to `postgresql+asyncpg://trader@10.10.0.2/dashboard?ssl=require`
  - Context: user asked 2026-04-23; Phase 2 left `.env` password plaintext because `DATABASE_URL` is bootstrap. File-perms + WG isolation are current protection; cert auth eliminates the secret entirely.
